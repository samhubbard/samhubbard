- 👋 Hi, I’m @samhubbard
- 👀 I’m primarily a game programmer, but I want to get better at art. Someday my art will be the prettiest art of all the art...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on <($%(@#@*&)%)#(#(@!&&###@>, I have no idea what to work on.
- 📫 How to reach me ... maybe try on here, it might notify me.
- 😑 Hopefully there will be something cool to be announced soon, but not likely.
